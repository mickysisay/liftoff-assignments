## Submission Instructions

### Overview
There has been countless times when I've wanted to cook something but end up not having all the ingredients that I needed.So I came up with an idea to solve that.
what if there was a web application where users login and share their favorite recipes,and a recipe can get upvoted based on if it's a good recipe or not. users 
can also look for recipes by either searching it using the name of the recipe or using the ingredients needed to make that recipe. 
### Features
User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to/log out from their profiles.
Search: Users will have the ability to search for other profiles, recipes using recipe name or recipes using ingredient needed to make it.
post a recipe: users have the ability to post recipes and can use whatever recipe they want to.
upvote system: when searching for recipes,recipes with most upvotes will appear higher than others.
